**Greetings from [Yazd](https://maps.app.goo.gl/w5HDyRetfmCX1yEy5)!**

Allow me to introduce myself - I'm Abuzar Ahmadi, a seasoned English teacher and Persian-English translator and editor with a passion for words that spans over 15 enriching years. Born and raised in the United States, I've had the privilege of immersing myself in the nuances of both English and Persian, making me your ideal bridge between languages.

My professional journey has been shaped by a diverse array of projects, ranging from the translation of intricate religious texts to the meticulous editing of medical articles, scientific research papers, and academic dissertations. I take pride in my ability to not just translate words, but to capture the essence and nuances of the source material, ensuring that the message remains intact and compelling in the target language.

Educationally, I hold a [Bachelor's degree in Industrial Safety](https://en.sbu.ac.ir/) and a [Master's degree in English Translation Studies](https://litd.atu.ac.ir/en). These qualifications have not only honed my linguistic prowess but have also equipped me with a deep understanding of research methodologies and the art of cross-cultural communication.

Beyond translation and editing, my journey has also led me to the rewarding world of teaching. For several years, I've been a dedicated English teacher for those eager to embark on their language learning journey. My teaching philosophy extends beyond the basics of reading, writing, speaking, and listening. I believe in nurturing critical thinking, creativity, and the development of well-rounded language skills. Every student I work with receives a tailored learning experience, because I understand that language is more than just words; it's a vessel for expression and connection.

When it comes to my work, I have an unwavering commitment to precision, clarity, and professionalism. I consider myself meticulous and dependable, always striving for excellence in everything I do. Staying abreast of the latest technologies and best practices in the field is a part of my professional creed, ensuring that I can offer you the highest quality of service.

I'm excited about the opportunity to explore how my expertise can assist you in achieving your translation and communication goals. Please don't hesitate to reach out to me. Let's start a conversation about how we can navigate the world of words together.
